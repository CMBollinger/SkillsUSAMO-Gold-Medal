                <ul>
                    <li>
                        ▪ Will you take my animal in? First thing we ask no matter what, “Where do you live?” If you do not live in the city limits they cannot bring an animal in. If animal is found within the city limits, they have to now sign an affidavit that they found the dog inside the city limits, we have those forms at the shelter. We are no longer accepting cats unless they are critically injured/sick or ‘without a mother. Any person in the County portion of Wilson County needing animal
                        control can call them at 615-444-9775. New Leash on Life may be able to help with some cats
                        and dogs they are 615-444-1144. Country K-9 is in Lebanon and they can sometimes help with
                        cats but mainly just dogs.
                    </li> <br>
                    <li>
                        ▪ We are NOT a no kill shelter. We do our best to adopt out animals but we cannot and will not
                        guarantee the adoption of any animal.
                    </li> <br>
                    <li>▪ We are open to the public Wednesdays from 11:30a until 3:30pm. </li> <br>
                    <li>▪ We will also take appointments on other days as needed. </li> <br>
                    <li>
                        ▪ Welfare checks on animals- people concerned for the welfare of an animal. We will check all of
                        these issues within the city limits.
                    </li> <br>
                    <li>
                        ▪ When turning in a dog we must have a photo ID with your city limits address or an ID with a bill
                        providing residency.
                    </li> <br>
                    <li>▪ Owner surrenders for dogs will be a 25 dollar fee. Paid check or exact cash </li> <br>
                    <li>
                        ▪ If we have picked up your animal and you need to claim it- you must set up an appointment if it
                        is any other day besides Wed and there will be fee. The fee is 25 dollars for the initial pick up, 10
                        each additional day- up to 5 days, then a 15 dollar fee if the dog does not have a rabies shot(this
                        fee will cover us getting the dog its shot).
                    </li> <br>
                    <li>
                        ▪ We do not do spay and neuter here at the shelter. Contact a local vet or Sumner County Spay
                        and Neuter Clinic.
                    </li> <br>
                    <li>
                        ▪ Cats... there is no state law that they cannot roam at large which is the reason we do not pick
                        them up as strays or take them i
                    </li>n. <br>

                    <li>
                        ▪ Adoptions- no animal will leave our shelter unaltered. The animals must be fixed no exceptions. 
                        If the animal being adopted is already fixed it is a 75 dollar fee and they can go home right away. 
                        If the animal is not altered, it is a 25 dollar fee and WE take the dog to the vet of the owner’s 
                        choice within the city limits of Mt. Pleasant only. The new owner will pay for the spay or neuter 
                        of the animal. The cost of that depends on if the adopted animal is male/female- cat/dog and 
                        which vet they go to. We have a price list for each vet.

                        ▪ If people are within Wilson County and in need of dog or cat food we will help provide it when
                        needed and available, with proof of animals being spayed and neutered, we will also help with

                        ▪ We do have a spay and neuter program available through a grant for low-income families. We
                        offer these services to help stop pet overpopulation.

                    <li>
                        ▪ Dogs found with rabies tag numbers- we can trace Rabies numbers through the health
                        department in Wilson county for county tags. You need the number and year to do this from the
                        tag. Call the Wilson Co Health Dept at 615-444-5325 and ask them to trace a tag. They will trace
                        it to the vet clinic that performed the vaccine. When you call the vet they can trace the tag to
                        the owner.

                        ▪ Lost and found animals- we take a report with basic information (cat/dog, sex, intact/neutered,
                        color/breed, collar or none, where lost, when lost) and we keep it in a book at the shelter. We
                        also tell them to check Wilson County lost and Found Pets page on FB. Debbie Moore runs that
                        page and is wonderful to work with and tags us in every post.

                        ▪ Community service-  if it is for school or court ordered. If court ordered they must first go down
                        to PD and speak with Lt. Chandler or Chief. They will give them their paperwork to begin
                        working. The best time to start is at 8 am as there is not much cleaning to be done in the
                        afternoon. They are not allowed to come in contact with the animals. They will be sweeping,
                        mopping, and doing dishes. The front doors will be closed so they need to come into the side
                        door by the large garage door.

                        just to get their hours in for school. Same rules apply they just bring their own paper work.
