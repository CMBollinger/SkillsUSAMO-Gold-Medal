                        Volunteers are the lifeblood of the Mt Pleasant Animal Shelter. We welcome volunteers of all ages, but
                        those under 18 must volunteer with a family member.
                        To volunteer, you must attend an orientation session, which are held monthly. You also must complete
                        the Volunteer Application2017. Complete it and bring with you to orientation.
                        Orientation should last about 1 hour, then you will set up your first volunteering time with a mentor
                        who is an experienced volunteer to show you the ins and out of everything we do here. After that you
                        will be certified to volunteer on your own.</p><br/>
                        <p class="display-6">A few notes:</p>
                            1. You must be 18 to volunteer, or with a parent or guardian at all times to be a volunteer.
                            <br/>2. The shelter is open to the volunteers EVERYDAY as the animals need to be cared for EVERYDAY!!
                            <br/>3. You may volunteer between the hours of 8-4 daily.
                            <br/>4. If you feel uncomfortable with an animal, DO NOT feel obligated to walk, or take it to the play
                        yard, or play room, each and every animal will be given their time to play throughout the day.
                        <br/>5. HAVE FUN!
                        <br/>THANK YOU TO ALL THE NEW VOLUNTEERS WHO CAME OUT, CAN’T WAIT TO SEE YOU ALL AT THE
                        SHELTER FOR LOTS OF VOLUNTEERING FUN!
                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        <p class="display-6">Certified Volunteers:</p>
                        <br/>▪ Must Attend an Orientation- Held on 3rd Thursday of each month at the Mt. Pleasant Animal
                        Shelter.
                        <br/>▪ Must be 18 years of age, any minors MUST be accompanied by their parent or guardian (no
                        exceptions)!
                        <br/>▪ Must be mentored by one of our approved volunteers prior to your first time volunteering.
                        <br/>▪ Can follow all signs as directed by staff at the shelter.
                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        <p class="display-6">Community Service:</p>
                        <br/>Those needing to fill community service hours may do so without attending volunteer training. They will
                        not be allowed to come in contact with the animals and may volunteer without a parent present if they
                        are under 18. It is recommended that those filling community service hours arrive at 8 a.m. and be
                        prepared to sweep, mop or do dishes.
                        <br/>▪ If it is school community service, students will need to bring paperwork.
                        <br/>▪ For court-ordered community service, visit the Mt Pleasant Police Department to receive
                        necessary paper work.
